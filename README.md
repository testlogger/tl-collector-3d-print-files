# TestLogger Collector 3D printing file library
This repository is used to share STL files for TestLogger Collector components like cases and sensor brackets. As everything is 3D printed in production versions, we want to share the models for the users to be able to print spare parts by themselves and also users can share their own designs for brackets for others to print.

# Contributing
If you like to contribute your models to this library, then you can send models via email to info@testlogger.com or upload it in Discord.
