## Magnet ring
Magnet ring has slot for four magnets. Designed magnet size is 3x1mm.
* Ring is designed to be installed to new outdrives, so make sure you clean any extra material from top level of outdrive if you use old outdrives.
* To install the ring, please push thinner part of the ring against outdrive o-ring. Make sure it doesn't touch eccentric hub so the magnet ring doesn't generate additional friction.
* Ring should fit in place quite nicely but it is ok to secure the installation with small amount of CA glue.

How install magnets?
1. Get long nose pliers or any pliers with fairly thin flat surface on the tip
2. Put piece of packing tape on the flat surface of the tip
3. Open the magnets in the sticker package. Keep magnets on top of the sticker and place sticker on table. Tip: Place the sticker on metal surface so magnets on top of the sticker will stay in place.
4. Take first magnet from the top with a tip of the pliers.
5. Put one drop of CA glue on flat edge of the magnet
6. Place magnet to one of the slots in magnet ring
7. Compress magnet to the slot gently with the pliers
8. Slide pliers off from the magnet
9. Repeat for other three magnets.
