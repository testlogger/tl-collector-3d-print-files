How install magnets?
1. Get long nose pliers or any pliers with fairly thin flat surface on the tip
2. Put piece of packing tape on the flat surface of the tip
3. Open the magnets in the sticker package. Keep magnets on top of the sticker and place sticker on table. Tip: Place the sticker on metal surface so magnets on top of the sticker will stay in place.
4. Take first magnet from the top with a tip of the pliers.
5. Place magnet to one of the slots in magnet ring. Magnets should be placed on the non-through holes. Through holes are here for balancing purposes only and should not hold any magnet.
6. Compress magnet to the slot gently with the pliers
7. Slide pliers off from the magnet
8. Repeat for other three magnets.

* Fix sensor to the bracket with 6mm shrink tube which comes with the wheel speed sensor
* You can adjust the sensor height by using spacers below the bracket. This would be necessary if you adjust the diff height.
